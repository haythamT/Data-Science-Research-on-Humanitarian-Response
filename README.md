Leveraging Data Science to Analyze the Humanitarian Response after the Beirut Port Blast

Abstract
On August 4, 2020, a massive seaport explosion devastated Beirut, Lebanon, exacerbating an already dire economic and social situation. This study aims to map the socioeconomic status of residents in the humanitarian operational zones around the port and the corresponding distribution of food aid to identify potential disparities in aid allocation. Leveraging geographical data from the Foursquare API, interactive mapping tools, web scraping, and machine learning algorithms, this research reveals significant insights into the effectiveness of aid distribution. The study highlights zones that received disproportionate aid compared to their socioeconomic status, demonstrating the potential of data science techniques in improving humanitarian response efforts. The findings are intended to assist researchers, humanitarian organizations, and citizens in enhancing the equity and efficiency of disaster recovery initiatives.
